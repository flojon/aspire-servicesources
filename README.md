# Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources

A .NET Aspire AppHost extension that lets `builder.AddService("orders")` resolve to a real,
running resource whose *source* is chosen per developer, not baked into the AppHost.

## Why

`AddProject<T>()` assumes a service lives in the AppHost's own solution. In a real
microservice environment, services live in separate repositories, and different developers
want different things for the same service: clone it locally to edit, run it from an
already-checked-out working copy, or just reach an instance already running in a shared
Kubernetes dev cluster. The AppHost should only describe *what* it depends on; where that
dependency actually comes from is a per-developer choice, made without ever touching the
AppHost's `.csproj`/`.sln`.

`AddService()` is the seam: the AppHost calls it once per service, and a developer-local
config file decides how it's actually resolved — today via a managed or self-managed local
git checkout (`"local"` source) or a `kubectl port-forward` against a dev cluster
(`"kubernetes"` source) — behind one stable return type, so the AppHost code never has to
change when a developer switches sources.

## Install

Published on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/flojon) as `Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources`:

```bash
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources
```

Or reference the project directly from your AppHost instead:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="path/to/Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources/Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Requires .NET 10 and an AppHost project using the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` (`aspire new` /
`aspire restore` sets this up).

## Getting started

**1. Declare the service in `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
using Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var orders = builder.AddService("orders");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(orders);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**2. Add the shared catalog, `servicesources.yaml`, next to the AppHost project (commit this
file):**

```yaml
services:
  orders:
    repository: https://github.com/example/orders
    project: src/Orders.Api/Orders.Api.csproj
    defaultRef: main          # optional; branch, tag, or commit SHA
```

**3. Add your own `servicesources.local.json` next to it (gitignore this file — it's
per-developer):**

```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": { "source": "local" }
  }
}
```

That's it — running the AppHost now clones `orders` into
`<AppHostDirectory>/.servicesources/checkouts/orders/`, checks out `main`, and runs it via
Aspire's own project orchestration, wired up to `api` through service discovery exactly like
a project reference would be.

### `"local"` source options

```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": { "source": "local" },
    "payments": {
      "source": "local",
      "path": "/home/dev/code/payments",
      "ref": "feature/new-checkout"
    }
  }
}
```

- Omit `path` for a managed checkout: cloned once into
  `<AppHostDirectory>/.servicesources/checkouts/<serviceName>/`, and reconciled to the
  configured `ref` (or the catalog's `defaultRef`) on every run. Uncommitted edits are never
  discarded — if the checkout is dirty and the ref changed, resolution fails loudly instead of
  overwriting your work.
- Set `path` to point at a checkout you manage yourself (e.g. an existing local clone). It's
  used as-is — no clone, no checkout, no fetch, ever. `ref` cannot be combined with `path`.

### `"kubernetes"` source

Point a service at an already-running instance in a Kubernetes dev cluster via
`kubectl port-forward`, instead of running it locally at all.

`servicesources.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
  orders:
    kubernetes:
      service: orders-svc
      port: 8080
```

`servicesources.local.json`:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": {
      "source": "kubernetes",
      "context": "dev-west",
      "namespace": "orders",
      "port": 8080
    }
  }
}
```

Requires `kubectl` on `PATH`, authenticated against the named `context`.

## Sample

`samples/DemoAppHost` is a minimal working AppHost wired up against `samples/SampleService`
via the `"local"` source with `path` — run it to see the whole flow end to end:

```bash
cd samples/DemoAppHost
cp servicesources.local.json.example servicesources.local.json
aspire run
```

## Status

Early stage, evolving fast. `"local"`, `"kubernetes"`, `"url"`, and `"container"` sources are
all implemented — see [`docs/superpowers/`](docs/superpowers/) for design and implementation
history, including the phase 2 backlog (repo auto-update, config discovery walk-up,
dependency/infrastructure resolution, and more).
