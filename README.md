# Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources

A .NET Aspire AppHost extension that lets `builder.AddService("orders")` resolve to a real,
running resource whose *source* is chosen per developer, not baked into the AppHost.

## Why

`AddProject<T>()` assumes a service lives in the AppHost's own solution. In a real
microservice environment, services live in separate repositories, and different developers
want different things for the same service: clone it locally to edit, run it from an
already-checked-out working copy, reach an instance already running in a shared Kubernetes
dev cluster, hit a fixed URL, or just run a published container image. The AppHost should
only describe *what* it depends on; where that dependency actually comes from is a
per-developer choice, made without ever touching the AppHost's `.csproj`/`.sln`.

`AddService()` is the seam: the AppHost calls it once per service, and a developer-local
config file decides how it's actually resolved — a managed or self-managed local git
checkout (`"local"`), a `kubectl port-forward` against a dev cluster (`"kubernetes"`), a
fixed, already-known URL (`"url"`), or a published container image run locally
(`"container"`) — behind one stable return type, so the AppHost code never has to change
when a developer switches sources.

## Install

Published on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/flojon) as `KoalaSoft.Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources`:

```bash
dotnet add package KoalaSoft.Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources
```

Services that aren't .NET projects need the satellite package for their language as well — see
[Non-.NET local services](#non-net-local-services-kind):

```bash
dotnet add package KoalaSoft.Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources.JavaScript
```

Or reference the project directly from your AppHost instead:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="path/to/Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources/Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Requires .NET 8 or later (net8.0, net9.0, and net10.0 are all supported) and an AppHost
project using the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` (`aspire new` / `aspire restore` sets this up).

## Getting started

**1. Declare the service in `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
using Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var orders = builder.AddService("orders");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(orders);

builder.Build().Run();
```

**2. Add the shared catalog, `servicesources.yaml`, next to the AppHost project (commit this
file):**

```yaml
services:
  orders:
    repository: https://github.com/example/orders
    project: src/Orders.Api/Orders.Api.csproj
    defaultRef: main          # optional; branch, tag, or commit SHA
```

(A service that isn't a .NET project also takes a `kind` — see
[Non-.NET local services](#non-net-local-services-kind).)

**3. Add your own `servicesources.local.json` next to it (gitignore this file — it's
per-developer):**

```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": { "source": "local" }
  }
}
```

That's it — running the AppHost now clones `orders` into
`<AppHostDirectory>/.servicesources/checkouts/orders/`, checks out `main`, and runs it via
Aspire's own project orchestration, wired up to `api` through service discovery exactly like
a project reference would be.

### `"local"` source options

```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": { "source": "local" },
    "payments": {
      "source": "local",
      "path": "/home/dev/code/payments",
      "ref": "feature/new-checkout"
    }
  }
}
```

- Omit `path` for a managed checkout: cloned once into
  `<AppHostDirectory>/.servicesources/checkouts/<serviceName>/`, and reconciled to the
  configured `ref` (or the catalog's `defaultRef`) on every run. Uncommitted edits are never
  discarded — if the checkout is dirty and the ref changed, resolution fails loudly instead of
  overwriting your work. The `.servicesources/` directory gitignores itself on first use — no
  need to add it to your own `.gitignore`.
- Set `path` to point at a checkout you manage yourself (e.g. an existing local clone). It's
  used as-is — no clone, no checkout, no fetch, ever. A relative `path` is anchored to the
  AppHost directory, and must name a directory that already exists. `ref` cannot be combined
  with `path`.

### Non-.NET local services: `kind`

A `"local"` service is resolved as a .NET project by default. Set `kind` in the catalog to run
the checkout some other way — the git clone/checkout is identical, only what gets built out of
the resulting directory changes:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    repository: https://github.com/example/frontend
    kind: javascript          # optional; defaults to "dotnet"
    javascript:               # per-kind options block, named after the kind
      appDirectory: .
      runScript: dev
```

`kind: dotnet` (the default) uses the entry's `project` property and needs no options block.
Any other kind is resolved by a handler that a satellite package registers, and its options
live in a block named after the kind. Kind names are matched case-sensitively, and a kind with
no registered handler fails at startup before anything is cloned.

#### JavaScript: `kind: javascript`

Provided by the `KoalaSoft.Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources.JavaScript` package, which runs the
checkout through [`Aspire.Hosting.JavaScript`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.JavaScript).
Install it, then call `UseJavaScript()` once, before the `AddService()` call for any such service:

```csharp
using Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.UseJavaScript();

var frontend = builder.AddService("frontend");
```

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    repository: https://github.com/example/frontend
    kind: javascript
    javascript:
      appType: vite         # javascript (default) | vite | nextjs | node | bun
      appDirectory: web     # directory holding package.json, relative to the repo root
      runScript: dev        # package.json script to run
      packageManager: pnpm  # npm | yarn | pnpm | bun
      port: 4321            # the port consumers reach the service on
```

Every option is optional:

- **`appType`** — which integration runs the app: `javascript` (the default, `AddJavaScriptApp`),
  `vite`, `nextjs`, `node`, or `bun`. `node` and `bun` execute a file directly rather than a
  `package.json` script, so they require `scriptPath`; the other three run a script and reject it.
- **`appDirectory`** — the directory holding the app's `package.json`, relative to the repository
  root, which is also the default. It must stay inside the checkout.
- **`runScript`** — the `package.json` script to run; the integrations default this to `dev`. For
  `node`/`bun` it overrides the `scriptPath` they would otherwise execute directly.
- **`scriptPath`** — the entry-point file (e.g. `server.js`) relative to `appDirectory`. Required
  by `appType: node` and `appType: bun`, and rejected for the others.
- **`packageManager`** — `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`, used to install dependencies before the
  app starts (a fresh clone has no `node_modules`). Left unset, the integration's own default
  applies: npm for most app types, Bun for `appType: bun`.
- **`port`** / **`targetPort`** — the port consumers reach the service on, and the port the app
  itself listens on. Both are allocated by Aspire when unset.
- **`portEnv`** — the environment variable the app reads its listen port from; defaults to `PORT`.
  Rejected for `vite`/`nextjs`, whose integrations bind the dev server's port themselves.

The service always gets an `http` endpoint, so the builder `AddService()` returns can be passed to
a consumer's `WithReference(...)` like any other. Node and Bun must be on `PATH` for the app types
that use them.

**Implementing a kind.** A satellite package implements `ILocalResourceKind` and registers it
from its own extension method:

```csharp
public sealed class JavaScriptKind : ILocalResourceKind
{
    private sealed class Options
    {
        public string? AppDirectory { get; set; }
        public string? RunScript { get; set; }
    }

    // Optional, and worth implementing whenever Resolve parses rawConfig: this runs for every
    // service before any of them has added a resource, so a typo'd options block is reported
    // alongside every other service's failure instead of aborting a half-built app model.
    public void Validate(string serviceName, object? rawConfig) =>
        LocalKindConfig.Parse<Options>(rawConfig, serviceName);

    public IResourceBuilder<IResourceWithServiceDiscovery> Resolve(
        IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder, string serviceName, string repoRoot, object? rawConfig)
    {
        // repoRoot is the already-cloned, already-checked-out directory.
        var options = LocalKindConfig.Parse<Options>(rawConfig, serviceName);
        ...
    }
}

public static IDistributedApplicationBuilder UseJavaScript(this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder) =>
    builder.AddLocalKind("javascript", new JavaScriptKind());
```

`LocalKindConfig.Parse<T>` turns the opaque options block into a typed object, and rejects an
unknown property or a block that isn't a mapping with a `ServiceSourcesConfigurationException`
naming the service. `AddLocalKind` must be called before the service resolves (i.e. before the
app host starts), accepts each kind name at most once, and cannot re-register `"dotnet"` or use a
name that collides with a well-known service property (`repository`, `project`, `defaultRef`,
`kind`, `kubernetes`, `url`, `container`) — a block by one of those names would be read as that
property rather than as the kind's options.

### `"kubernetes"` source

Point a service at an already-running instance in a Kubernetes dev cluster via
`kubectl port-forward`, instead of running it locally at all.

`servicesources.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
  orders:
    kubernetes:
      service: orders-svc
      port: 8080
```

`servicesources.local.json`:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": {
      "source": "kubernetes",
      "context": "dev-west",
      "namespace": "orders",
      "port": 8080
    }
  }
}
```

Requires `kubectl` on `PATH`, authenticated against the named `context`.

### `"url"` source

Point a service at a fixed, already-known URL — e.g. a Kubernetes ingress, a staging
deployment, or any other reachable HTTP(S) endpoint. There's no underlying resource for
Aspire to run; the facade's endpoint resolves straight to the configured URL.

`servicesources.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
  orders:
    url:
      url: https://orders.example.com
```

`servicesources.local.json`:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": { "source": "url" }
  }
}
```

Set `url` in the developer config instead to override the catalog's URL for just that
developer (e.g. pointing at a personal tunnel or local proxy):

```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": { "source": "url", "url": "https://orders.dev.internal" }
  }
}
```

### `"container"` source

Run a published container image locally via Aspire's own container-runtime integration —
image pull and lifecycle are managed entirely by Aspire.

`servicesources.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
  orders:
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/company/orders
      port: 8080
      defaultTag: latest
```

`servicesources.local.json`:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": { "source": "container" }
  }
}
```

Set `tag` in the developer config to override the catalog's `defaultTag` for just that
developer:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "orders": { "source": "container", "tag": "v1.4.2" }
  }
}
```

### Combining sources on one catalog entry

A single `servicesources.yaml` entry can carry blocks for every source at once — the catalog
just describes *how* each source would resolve the service; each developer's
`servicesources.local.json` picks which one actually applies to them:

```yaml
services:
  orders:
    repository: https://github.com/example/orders
    project: src/Orders.Api/Orders.Api.csproj
    kubernetes:
      service: orders-svc
      port: 8080
    url:
      url: https://orders.example.com
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/example/orders
      port: 8080
      defaultTag: latest
```

A developer editing the service picks `"local"`; one debugging against a shared dev cluster
picks `"kubernetes"`; one who just needs it reachable picks `"url"` or `"container"` — same
catalog entry, same `AddService("orders")` call in the AppHost, no code changes either way.
Each developer's own `servicesources.local.json` just names which source applies to them —
editing `orders` locally:

```json
{ "services": { "orders": { "source": "local" } } }
```

debugging against a shared dev cluster:

```json
{ "services": { "orders": { "source": "kubernetes", "context": "dev-west", "namespace": "orders", "port": 8080 } } }
```

or just needing it reachable, not caring how:

```json
{ "services": { "orders": { "source": "url" } } }
```

## Sample

`samples/DemoAppHost` is a minimal working AppHost demonstrating all three easily-runnable
sources: `orders` via a real managed `"local"` git checkout (a small project cloned from
[`dotnet/aspire-samples`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples)), `inventory` via the
`"url"` source (pointing at [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org), a live public test API), and
`payments` via the `"container"` source (the `nginxdemos/hello` hello-world image) — run it to
see the whole flow end to end. (`"kubernetes"` isn't demoed here since it needs a real cluster
and `kubectl`; see its section above.)

```bash
cd samples/DemoAppHost
cp servicesources.local.json.example servicesources.local.json
aspire run
```

A TypeScript AppHost equivalent — proving `AddService()` is correctly exported and registers with
Aspire's Type System from a guest language — lives in `samples/DemoAppHostTypeScript` (**note:**
this sample does not currently run end-to-end — see the known issue below the code block for why):

```bash
cd samples/DemoAppHostTypeScript
npm install
cp servicesources.local.json.example servicesources.local.json
aspire restore
aspire run
```

**Known issue:** as of Aspire CLI 13.4.6/13.5.0, `aspire restore`/`aspire add` correctly
registers `addService(name: string)` in the generated TypeScript SDK (`.aspire/modules/aspire.mts`)
with no diagnostics — confirming Task 1's `[AspireExport]` on `AddService` works — but the
generated SDK fails to compile (`TS2552: Cannot find name 'ResourceWithServiceDiscoveryPromise'`)
because the Aspire CLI's TypeScript codegen doesn't emit a `*Promise`/`*PromiseImpl` wrapper pair
for extension methods that return a bare Aspire interface type
(`IResourceBuilder<IResourceWithServiceDiscovery>`) rather than a concrete resource class. This
appears to affect any integration whose exported method returns a bare Aspire interface rather
than a concrete resource class, though we've only confirmed it for this one. Tracked upstream at
[microsoft/aspire#19507](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/19507); until that's fixed,
`aspire run` on this sample fails at its TypeScript build step even though the export itself is
correctly registered.

## Status

Early stage, evolving fast. `"local"`, `"kubernetes"`, `"url"`, and `"container"` sources are
all implemented — see [`docs/superpowers/`](docs/superpowers/) for design and implementation
history, including the phase 2 backlog (repo auto-update, config discovery walk-up,
dependency/infrastructure resolution, and more).
