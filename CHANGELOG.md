# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). While the
version is below `1.0.0`, a breaking change can ship in a minor release, so each one gets a
**Breaking** entry saying what stops compiling and how to migrate.

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking

- **Removed the public `ServiceResource` type** ([#62]). `AddService()` used to return a
  builder over a `ServiceResource` facade that was deliberately never added to
  `builder.Resources`. It now returns a builder over the resource Aspire actually runs — a
  `ProjectResource` for `local`, an Aspire container or executable resource for `container`
  and `kubernetes`, or whatever an `ILocalResourceKind` returns.

  `AddService()`'s declared return type is unchanged,
  `IResourceBuilder<IResourceWithServiceDiscovery>` before and after, so call sites that
  only pass the result to `WithReference(...)` or `GetEndpoint(...)` keep compiling. What
  breaks is code that *names* the type:

  ```csharp
  // No longer compiles - the type is gone:
  ServiceResource resource = builder.AddService("orders").Resource;
  if (builder.AddService("orders").Resource is ServiceResource) { /* ... */ }
  ```

  An assembly compiled against `0.2.0` that references `ServiceResource` throws
  `TypeLoadException` at runtime against this version. Recompile it.

  To configure the resolved service, use the new `Configure<T>()`, or `As<T>()` when you
  need the concrete resource type:

  ```csharp
  builder.AddService("orders")
      .Configure<IResourceWithEnvironment>(r => r.WithReference(ordersDb))
      .Configure<IResourceWithWaitSupport>(r => r.WaitForCompletion(migrations));

  IResourceBuilder<ProjectResource> web = builder.AddService("web").As<ProjectResource>();
  ```

  Extension calls made directly on the returned builder — `.WithEnvironment(...)` and
  friends — used to compile and then silently no-op against the unregistered facade. They
  now reach a registered resource, so configuration that was previously dead starts taking
  effect.

### Added

- `Configure<T>()` and `As<T>()`, for configuring the resource a service resolved to from
  the AppHost that called `AddService()` ([#62], fixes [#53]). `Configure<T>` is skipped
  with a logged warning for the `url` and `kubernetes` sources, which run out of band;
  `As<T>` throws for them.
- A `kind` extension point for the `local` source: `ILocalResourceKind` and
  `AddLocalKind(...)` let a satellite package teach `local` to run a non-.NET service
  ([#55], closes [#41]).
- Authentication for private git repositories, resolved through the developer's existing
  git credential helpers ([#56]).
- `AddService()` is exported to Aspire's Type System, so TypeScript AppHosts can call
  `builder.addService('orders')` ([#51]).
- Port bounds validation (1-65535) for the `kubernetes` source, matching the check the
  `container` source already had ([#40], fixes [#23]).

### Changed

- Developer-config fields that a service's source does not use — `port` under a `local`
  source, `context` under a `container` source — now fail fast with a
  `ServiceSourcesConfigurationException` naming every offending field, instead of being
  silently ignored ([#43], fixes [#24]).
- `local` services resolve eagerly during `AddService()` rather than at `BeforeStartEvent`,
  because a real resource has to exist by the time `AddService()` returns ([#62]). Cold
  checkouts still run in parallel — the first `AddService()` starts a prefetch for every
  `local` service in the catalog — so wall-clock is unchanged. Consequences: a checkout
  failure now throws from the failing `AddService()` call rather than being aggregated
  across services, `ILocalResourceKind.Validate` no longer runs before any service has
  touched the app model, and `AddLocalKind(...)` must be called before the first
  `AddService()`.
- Superseded preview packages are pruned from the GitHub Packages feed after each release,
  keeping the five most recent ([#68]).

### Fixed

- A service consumed by a *container* now works for every source except `url` ([#62], fixes
  [#58]). The resource returned by `AddService()` is registered with the app model, so DCP
  creates the Service object a container-to-container reference needs. For `url`, a
  `BeforeStartEvent` pre-flight now reports the unsupported combination clearly instead of
  letting DCP fail with `Host endpoint ... should have an associated DCP Service resource`;
  lifting that limitation is tracked as [#72].

### Documentation

- nuget.org version and download badges, and a Preview builds section explaining that the
  GitHub Packages feed needs a `read:packages` token ([#67]).
- How to run several services out of one repository ([#64]).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- `net8.0` and `net9.0` targets alongside `net10.0` ([#39]).
- README documentation for the `url` and `container` sources, and a sample AppHost that
  exercises every source ([#39]).
- NuGet discoverability tags on the package ([#38]).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-18

Initial release, published to nuget.org as `KoalaSoft.Aspire.Hosting.ServiceSources`.
Targets `net10.0`.

### Added

- `builder.AddService("name")`, resolving a service from a `servicesources.yaml` catalog
  plus a per-developer `servicesources.local.json` override, so where a service comes from
  is a developer's choice rather than something baked into the AppHost.
- Four sources: `local` (a managed git checkout, or a self-managed working copy via
  `path`), `kubernetes` (a `kubectl port-forward` against a dev cluster), `url` (a fixed,
  already-known URL), and `container` (a published image run locally).
- Git checkout management over LibGit2Sharp: clone, fetch-and-retry for a ref that is not
  resolvable locally, and a guard against discarding uncommitted changes in a checkout.
- Local checkouts keyed per service under the AppHost directory, resolved in parallel at
  `BeforeStartEvent`.
- Fail-fast configuration validation with `ServiceSourcesConfigurationException`.
- MIT license, README, symbol packages, and Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to nuget.org.
